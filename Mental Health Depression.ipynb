Seriously. In the 4 years I\\'ve known her I\\'ve never seen her cry.I am *so* sick of being perceived as not doing anything when I do everything I\\'m told and more. It drives me insane.I mean it\\'s not like I made three lists, restocked the entire candy section and dusted the entire store. Pshh.BUT since we made her wait thirty minutes for our pizza I apparently did NOTHING for the past few days except sit on my ass.and seriously I tried my hardest to have everything done on her damn list by the time she got there. And it was to an extent.BUT. Apparently since we made her wait thirty minutes to get our pizza that was all invalidated. We didn\\'t do anything. Allegedly.We ended up making about $300 in thirty minutes and that was pretty cool.I mean EVERYONE decided to come in at that time and people were super needy and we were doing the best we could tbh.She was supposed to pick up pizza and we were supposed to order it but we got slammed and there was no way for us to get to the phones.Anyway. My boss made my coworker cry and me pissed beyond belief.ughh...yeah shit just hit the fan.UGH MY BOSS IS LETTING US CLOSE AT 1:30!

Seriously.The cafeteria ALSO charges extra for low transactions. We do not, hence the limit. We would make no money off a $1.75 purchase on a card.The cafeteria jacked up their prices. We did not. They can do whatever they want since they raised to mirror the bank fees.I will explain.

I can\\'t put $1.75 on your card\"\" do NOT give me the bitchface.@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos nah nevermind.

It sounds very wise.It\\'s so rare that all four of us are here upstairs. Tali has so many people to smell during the movie.@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l Plato, Betham, Mills. Got it.Finally convinced dad that we only needed to watch the original trilogy. Success.@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I\\'ve never actually studied it. I probably will eventually. Sounds like my kinda thing.Nick Valentine better get max approval after this damn quest.

They tried that a few years back didn\\'t stick.@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso ahhhh if only it were that simple.@TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso actually completely impossible to be honest.@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso eh. It honestly is what we make of it. My beliefs are kinda hard to summarize.@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso Same actually. Twitter is not made for theological discussions@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos wait I do. So God\\'s will is chair fights?@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos ...I legit do not know how to respond to that.@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos so classy because divine beings can do whatever they want? Pshh@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos cmon now surely it\\'d be classier than that. Surely.@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I know. I work in retail. I KNOW.@GenevieveVerso if I were truly bright I wouldn\\'t have gotten so lost in this stupid game just now.@TheFuxedos another one? I thought that event was last thanksgiving.@GenevieveVerso oh pshh. Not really.@GenevieveVerso yeah once I get one of those fancy Masters degrees I can move out. Only just got an associates so it\\'ll be awhile.@GenevieveVerso I say I\\'m independent while living rent free at my parents house so eh?@GenevieveVerso what can I say I\\'m an independent woman?@GenevieveVerso eh. I\\'ll just try to get one of those degree things and see if I can get one of those job things@GenevieveVerso yeah. I\\'m fresh out of those.@GenevieveVerso I dot actually get too much attention. Mostly because I don\\'t go anywhere.@GenevieveVerso yeah the big blue doe eyes don\\'t exactly help with scariness.@GenevieveVerso yeah. We seem to be in the same boat. I\\'m actually 5\\'2 and look barely legal so if you actually have an arsenal can we share@GenevieveVerso scary guy friends are a must while out in public@GenevieveVerso aaaaand this is why I don\\'t interact with people outside the Internet.@MissLusyd not too much a pie person. Or a tea person. I have very plain tastes.@MissLusyd is it sweet and delicious?@MissLusyd I don\\'t drink but that looks amazing.@GenevieveVerso daw thanks. ~&lt;3@GenevieveVerso personally I think I look like I\\'m 12 but y\\'know.@GenevieveVerso eh. Like I said I\\'m mostly doing this for my health.@GenevieveVerso I\\'m not. I\\'m jus really really short and 170 may not be a lot to some people but I SHOULD be 125@GenevieveVerso dude I\\'m not one of them. I\\'ve never broken a bone in my life.@GenevieveVerso actually there\\'s a legit reason: I broke my toe last year by standing on it. My bones can\\'t handle being this heavy.@GenevieveVerso but I COULD have a perfect ass and be even cuter.@GenevieveVerso it\\'s the booty. I need to get rid of it.   that\\'s sweet but I am on the chubby side and my body needs to be thinner to be healthy. Delicate bones, y\\'see.@ProfessorOtaku too pure...too precious for this world.@ProfessorOtaku ...look I am well aware that I am tiny and chubby but I can have dreams.@ProfessorOtaku DO YOU NOT BELIEVE MEOne of these days I will do enough sit ups to have abs of steel. *sigh* why is exercising so haaaaaaardNo snuggles until princess Tali has filled her quota of kitty fetch. No sleeping either unless you want your face lickedPrincess Tali DEMANDS to play kitty fetch. Or else she will make sad crying noises.@PikaHikariKT they\\'re all in my bed somewhere.Tali keeps stealing my hair ties for kitty fetch to the point where I have none because she has lost most of them.No it doesn\\'t matter what you\\'re doing or what time it is. You will play Kitty fetch when Kitty wants to play Kitty fetch.@Tauri3l @MissLusyd @azarkansero blech@MissLusyd not to mention most likely fatal. HEYO.@MissLusyd oh god. I dunno. Can we really top car fucking?@MissLusyd good! Now we can move on to something more fun!@MissLusyd just remember not everyone sucks. I know it\\'s hard. Especially since I\\'ve cut myself off from actual people@MissLusyd I don\\'t *actually* follow my own advice though.@MissLusyd am I sounding preachy? I just like helping people.@MissLusyd you should carry yourself in a way as such. Like you shouldn\\'t change anything except how you think about yourself.@MissLusyd well the way I see it, if you *think* everyone thinks that, there\\'s a possibility they do. Fuck them. You ARE a person and-@MissLusyd it could be. Personally I think it looks awesome but different is treated differently by the public@MissLusyd I hate people sometimes.@Tauri3l @MissLusyd tear him to pieces. Then screenshot it and show us.@MissLusyd seriously? If you don\\'t mind me asking, why?@MissLusyd we all have our coping mechanisms. And I think no human being should treat another like shit but eh? life happens.@MissLusyd I bet. Destroying men\\'s concept of existence sounds so badass tbh.@MissLusyd ahh yes. I wasn\\'t too good at messing with them, my trolling techniques are too uncreative. I\\'m sure you\\'re a master at it.@MissLusyd yeah after the 50thish one I was bored. It\\'s like the same guy was messaging me from different accounts@MissLusyd I always got the \"lonely gamer\" types.@MissLusyd mine was too at first but it stopped being funny after a few months so I stopped.@MissLusyd see that\\'s why I left those sites years ago. I am a weird creepy guy magnet as well.@MissLusyd oh god. That\\'s terrifying.@LonerDreamer eh that and messing with mccready seem to be doing it for her@LonerDreamer well she just got done with finals. I think she\\'s exercising pent up rage. It\\'s hard being an engineering major apparently@LonerDreamer she also ditches him frequently and \"accidentally\" shoots him. Yet she won\\'t change companions for some reason@LonerDreamer also everytime he complains about her hoarding she changes his outfit and gives him all her junk.@LonerDreamer yeah I vaguely remember him in fallout 3. It\\'s been a few years but it\\'s really recent for her. The memories are still fresh@LonerDreamer @PikaHikariKT I shudder at the thought of if she finds one even more ridiculous looking.@tskimoongoddess I\\'m too nice to do that. Such a shame.@tskimoongoddess she\\'s just incredibly tacky with looting and extorting caps. Also underleveled like 70% of the time.@PikaHikariKT also she does a lot of other stuff to him too. Push him off lifts, dress him in bright clothes, etc.@PikaHikariKT I should\\'ve taken a picture of the hat of shame, then.I have no idea why she takes delight in torturing that poor man but it\\'s amazingAlso there\\'s the fact that she makes MacCready wear the \"hat of shame\" for \"being a turd in Fallout 3\"Y\\'know the really dumb decisions that you try not to make in games? She makes all of them because why notI think watching my sister play fallout 4 might be just as fun as playing it if not more.Sleepy kitty.   wellllll actually you can\\'t change his clothes until his exile apparently. danse\\'@LonerDreamer I will definitely take pictures.my sister says she\\'s gonna dress everyone like that.    are tears. his legs look lovely.   @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos wow.

A transposing nightmare.@azarkansero yeaaaaaah I am the worst brass player in the history of brass players. Thing is, you guys are tuned differently and it THROWSME@azarkansero string instruments are a series of half and whole steps. If you know the string names you\\'re halfway there.@azarkansero otherwise it seems braggy@azarkansero thing is, it\\'s very misleading. I feel the need to explain that if you know one string instrument you know most of them.@azarkansero I can\\'t stress enough how mediocre I am music wise.@azarkansero like I said. Not really impressive.@azarkansero I was a music Ed major like four years ago. That\\'s why. Also I have a mezzo soprano vocal range.@azarkansero a mandolin is a violin with frets. I also play guitar, piano, and I\\'ve been instructed in trumpet and baritone@azarkansero Violin, viola, cello, and bass. All part of the same family@azarkansero it\\'s a lot less impressive than it sounds. Seriously.@azarkansero I used to doodle but I got in trouble for it.@azarkansero can\\'t write, never trained properly to draw. I\\'m a mediocre musician who can barely play 9 instruments. Can\\'t contribute much.@MissLusyd ah. I dislike the taste of alcohol so I never drink.@azarkansero eh. She kinda blended in the background to me.@azarkansero I found a one shot that explored it and I wanted it to be longer. It\\'s a shame I can\\'t write.@MissLusyd don\\'t get too hammered, mmkay?@azarkansero ah, Tumblr. Well, I dot see too much about piper but I see a LOT of Hancock@azarkansero also it\\'s possible the SS met Prewar Nick since she was a lawyer@azarkansero I reallyreally wanted to romance Nick though.

I\\'m only romancing Hancock because Nick is unavailable.@BattleMonkeyz yeah there\\'s only three of us and 2 registers.@azarkansero she\\'s so funny.@azarkansero I\\'m actually a pretty silent player. I\\'ll yell at companions and talk to the screen but my sister should stream, tbh.@BattleMonkeyz yes less shit is good. Hopefully I\\'m not running the sale solo like last week.@azarkansero it was less badass because a) she\\'s wearing the outfit with yellow shorts and b) she screams a lot@MissLusyd ...having fun? :D@BattleMonkeyz had to go home early because I felt like shit. I rested, still feel like shit but less shit.@BattleMonkeyz trying to get healthy before the big sale tomorrow.@Arcadyagami I CANT STOP PLAYING. There\\'s so much todo.@azarkansero she\\'s level 5, has no ammo and armed with a machete.@azarkansero I\\'m jealous.

I\\'m sorry, father.But my dad INSISTS we watch the prequels because \"we must prepare\".Of course I\\'ll join once they start the original.So my sister is home and my dad has roped her into watching all six Star Wars movies.

Wish me luck!Also starting to get to the point in Fallout 4 where I have to search for doable side quests. Not that I\\'m complaining.
